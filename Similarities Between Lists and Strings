#A list value is a mutable value type (added, removed, or changed), string values are immutable and cannot be changed

name= 'Zophie the cat'
name[7]
't'

#string cannot be changed, so we have to use slices

newName = name[0:7] + 'the' + name[8:12]
newName

#The differnce between immutable and mutable comes up with 'references'
